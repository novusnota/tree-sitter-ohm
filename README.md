# tree-sitter-ohm
üå≥ Tree-sitter grammar for the Ohm domain-specific language. Quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages with Ohm's parsing toolkit!

## üé® Structure

Grammar definition resides in `grammar.js`:

- Actual grammar and bindings are generated from it via Tree-sitter.
- Queries and tests rely on its namings of nodes and fields.

Generic queries are structured as follows:

```
queries/
|-- highlights.scm -- syntax highlighting queries (generic, for Tree-sitter & GitHub)
|-- locals.scm -- fixed set of capture names to track local scopes and variables (and alike)
|-- injections.scm -- specification for embedded syntaxes (mainly used for TODO/FIXME highlighting in comments)
`-- tags.scm -- tagging queries for code navigation systems (as used on GitHub)
```

To find highlighting and other queries for specific editors, look in the `editor_queries/` directory.

## üí≤ CLI Usage

Tree-sitter grammars have limited utility on their own and are best used as parsers that can be embedded in other projects. However, [tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/cli/README.md) can be used with this grammar to show generated parse trees and syntax highlighting for a given ohm file.

For a quick demo of tree-sitter-cli usage:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install Node.js dependencies (by `npm i`, `pnpm i` or `yarn`).
3. Execute relevant commands from the `scripts` tag in `package.json`.

For a more streamlined experience, you may:
1. [Install tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/cli/README.md#installation).
2. Create a `tree-sitters` directory in your home directory.
3. Clone this repository (or symlink it) into the new `~/tree-sitters/` directory.
4. Run `tree-sitter parse path/to/file.ohm` to be shown the parse tree for the file.
5. Run `tree-sitter highlight path/to/file.ohm` to be shown the file with syntax highlighting applied.
