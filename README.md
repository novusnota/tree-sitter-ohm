# tree-sitter-ohm
üå≥ Tree-sitter grammar for the Ohm domain-specific language. Quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages with Ohm's parsing toolkit!

## üé® Structure

Grammar definition resides in `grammar.js`:

- Actual grammar and bindings are generated from it via Tree-sitter.
- Queries and tests rely on its namings of nodes and fields.

Generic queries are structured as follows:

```
queries/
|-- highlights.scm -- syntax highlighting queries (generic, for Tree-sitter & GitHub)
|-- locals.scm -- fixed set of capture names to track local scopes and variables (and alike)
|-- injections.scm -- specification for embedded syntaxes (mainly used for TODO/FIXME highlighting in comments)
`-- tags.scm -- tagging queries for code navigation systems (as used on GitHub)
```

To find highlighting and other queries for specific editors, look in the `editor_queries/` directory.

## üöÄ Usage

### Helix

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

1. Clone the repo to any convenient place: `git clone https://github.com/novusnota/tree-sitter-ohm ~/.local/git/tree-sitter-ohm` (`~/.local/git` is exemplary, you may choose another directory)

2. Create a folder for queries under your Helix runtime directory, if not exists:
  * Windows: `mkdir -p ~\AppData\Roaming\helix\runtime\queries`
  * Linux, macOS, *NIX: `mkdir -p ~/.config/helix/runtime/queries`

3. Symlink the `editor_queries/helix` sub-directory, this will add all the queries:
  * Windows: `mklink /D ~\AppData\Roaming\helix\runtime\queries\ohm ~\.local\git\tree-sitter-ohm\editor_queries\helix`
  * Linux, macOS, *NIX: `ln -s ~/.local/git/tree-sitter-ohm/editor_queries/helix ~/.config/helix/runtime/queries/ohm`

4. Add the following to your `~/.config/helix/languages.toml` (Or `~\AppData\Roaming\helix\languages.toml` on Windows):

```toml
[[language]]
name = "ohm"
scope = "source.ohm"
injection-regex = "ohm"
file-types = ["ohm"]
comment-token = "//"
indent = { tab-width = 2, unit = "  " }
roots = []

[language.auto-pairs]
'"' = '"'
'{' = '}'
'(' = ')'
'<' = '>'

[[grammar]]
name = "ohm"
source = { path = "/absolute/path/to/your/home/directory/.local/git/tree-sitter-ohm" }  # TODO: replace with your full path to downloaded repo
```

5. Finally, run the following commands to update all Tree-sitter grammars, including ohm's:

```bash
hx --grammar fetch
hx --grammar build
```

</details>

Queries bundled (see `editor_queries/helix`):
* `highlights.scm` ‚Äî syntax highlighting
* `injections.scm` ‚Äî highlighting of TODO, FIXME and related in single-line comments
* `indents.scm` ‚Äî indentation levels
* `textobjects.scm` ‚Äî syntax aware text-objects

## üí≤ CLI Usage

Tree-sitter grammars have limited utility on their own and are best used as parsers that can be embedded in other projects. However, [tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/cli/README.md) can be used with this grammar to show generated parse trees and syntax highlighting for a given ohm file.

For a quick demo of tree-sitter-cli usage:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install Node.js dependencies (by `npm i`, `pnpm i` or `yarn`).
3. Execute relevant commands from the `scripts` tag in `package.json`.

For a more streamlined experience, you may:
1. [Install tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/cli/README.md#installation).
2. Create a `tree-sitters` directory in your home directory.
3. Clone this repository (or symlink it) into the new `~/tree-sitters/` directory.
4. Run `tree-sitter parse path/to/file.ohm` to be shown the parse tree for the file.
5. Run `tree-sitter highlight path/to/file.ohm` to be shown the file with syntax highlighting applied.
